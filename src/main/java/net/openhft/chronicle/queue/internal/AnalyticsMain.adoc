= AnalyticMain

== Trying Analytics
The `AnalyticsMain` is a program that creates two queues for the purpose of demonstrating the new analytics feature.
Because chronicle-analytics is currently set to limit the number of events to four per hour per JVM instance, only some events might be sent upstream.

== Setup

Before trying out the feature, `chronicle-queue` must be on the correct feature branch:

.Chronicle-Queue
[source, shell script]
----
Chronicle-Queue % git checkout feature/analytics
Chronicle-Queue % mvn clean install
----

NOTE: Analytics will detect if run under JUnit and (by default) prevent any events from being sent during testing. This setting can be overridden in the analytics builder.

== Run

Enter the following command to run:

.Chronicle-Queue
[source, shell script]
----
Chronicle-Queue % mvn exec:java@AnalyticsMain
----

The version of the library will be extracted from a META_INF/maven file.
