= AnalyticMain

== Trying Analytics
The `AnalyticsMain` is a program that creates two queues for the purpose of demonstrating the new analytics feature.

== Setup

Before trying out the feature, both core and queue must use the correct feature branches:

.Chronicle-Core (please note the "2" at the end of the feature branch name)
[source, shell script]
----
Chronicle-Core % git checkout feature/analytics2
Chronicle-Core % mvn clean install
----

Now, update the Chronicle BOM to use the core SNAPSHOT version above and add the following line at the top of the dependencies tag:

[source, xml]
----
            <!-- core projects -->
            <dependency>
                <groupId>net.openhft</groupId>
                <artifactId>chronicle-analytics</artifactId>
                <version>2.20.1</version>
            </dependency>
----

then, rebuild the BOM using `mvn clean install`.

.Chronicle-Queue
[source, shell script]
----
Chronicle-Queue % git checkout feature/analytics
Chronicle-Queue % mvn clean install
----

== Run

Enter the following command to run:

.Chronicle-Queue
[source, shell script]
----
Chronicle-Queue % mvn exec:java@AnalyticsMain
----
